# radial-profile-utils
A collection of code to create radial profiles, measure total flux for noisy data and find effective radii.

-- ProfileUtils contains the functions used to set up our data to pass through radial_profile.py and to analyze thereafter.

-- sampe_data containes the images and galaxy name text file used for our jupyter notebook example 'sample_notebook.ipynb'.

-- radial_profile.py and radial_profile_utils.py contain the main functions to create our radial profile (credit: @BearBearCodes)
